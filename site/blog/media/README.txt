Why are some of the files in here .gitignored from the repo?

GitHub doesn't let us store files >100MB in a regular repo.
Normally that's fine, you would just use LFS, but for some reason
that just doesn't work here.

Until I can figure out a better solution, they are simply excluded from the repo,
and can only be downloaded from wii-linux.org directly.
