This is the Wii Linux archive.

Old crap goes here to die.
Here you can find old, deprecated releases, and old releases of things
before a new fix or the like came out.

Zero support will be given for these, and there is no garuantee
that you can cobble together a working install out of any mix of it.

Good luck.
